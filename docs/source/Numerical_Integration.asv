Numerical Integration
==============

Numerical integration, also known as quadrature, is a collection of techniques used to approximate the definite integral of a function. This is essential when:   

-Analytical solutions are intractable: Finding the antiderivative of a function can be extremely difficult or impossible.   
-The function is only known at specific points: Data might be collected experimentally or through simulations.   

Key Concepts:

-Approximation: Numerical integration methods approximate the area under the curve of a function by dividing it into smaller shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, etc.) and summing their areas.   
-Accuracy: The accuracy of the approximation depends on the method used, the number of subdivisions, and the smoothness of the function.

Common Methods:
-Riemann Sums: Basic approach using rectangles.   
-Trapezoidal Rule: Approximates the curve with straight lines.   
-Simpson's Rule: Approximates the curve with parabolic arcs.
-Gaussian Quadrature: Uses strategically placed points for higher accuracy.   
Applications:

Engineering: Calculating work done by a variable force, determining the volume of irregular shapes.
Physics: Finding the center of mass, calculating probabilities in statistical mechanics.   
Finance: Pricing options and other financial derivatives.   
Computer Graphics: Rendering realistic images and animations.
