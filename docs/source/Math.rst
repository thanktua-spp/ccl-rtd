Deconv
======
   Description: 
       Performs polynomial deconvolution (division) of two polynomials and returns the quotient and remainder.
       Mathematically, this can be represented as:

       .. math::
          P(x) = D(x) * Q(x) + R(x)
       where P(x) is the dividend polynomial, D(x) is the divisor polynomial, Q(x) is the quotient polynomial, and R(x) is the remainder polynomial.
   Param: 
      | Polynomial:  The coefficients of the dividend polynomial (numerator).
      | Divisor:  The coefficients of the divisor polynomial (denominator).
   Returns: 
       A tuple containing two arrays:
          - Quotient: The coefficients of the quotient polynomial.
          - Remainder: The coefficients of the remainder polynomial.
   Example: 

          .. math::
             P(x) = x^5 + 2x^4 + 3x^3 + 4x^2 + 5x + 6,~ D(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3
       In this example, we perform polynomial deconvolution on two polynomials.
       The dividend polynomial is represented by the coefficients { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } and the divisor polynomial by { 1, 2, 3 }.

       .. code-block:: CSharp 

          // import libraries
          using System;
          using CypherCrescent.MathematicsLibrary.Math;
      
          // Example of performing polynomial deconvolution
          double[] Polynomial = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
          double[] Divisor = [1, 2, 3];
          var result = Deconv(Polynomial, Divisor);
          // Print the result
          Console.WriteLine($"Quotient: {string.Join(", ", result.Quotient)}");
          Console.WriteLine($"Remainder: {string.Join(", ", result.Remainder)}");

      Output: 


       .. code-block:: Terminal 

          Quotient: 1, 0, 0, 4
          Remainder: 0, 0, 0, 0, -3, -6


Conv
====
   Description: 
       Performs polynomial convolution (multiplication) of two polynomials and returns the resulting polynomial.
       Mathematically, this can be represented as:

       .. math::
          C(x) = P(x) * M(x)
       where P(x) is the first polynomial, M(x) is the second polynomial, and C(x) is the resulting polynomial.
   Param: 
      | Polynomial:  The coefficients of the first polynomial.
      | Multiplier:  The coefficients of the second polynomial.
   Returns: 
       An array containing the coefficients of the resulting polynomial.
   Example: 

          .. math::
             P(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3,~ M(x) = x + 1
       In this example, we perform polynomial convolution on two polynomials.
       The first polynomial is represented by the coefficients { 1, 2, 3 } and the second polynomial by { 1, 1 }.

       .. code-block:: CSharp 

          // import libraries
          using System;
          using CypherCrescent.MathematicsLibrary.Math;
      
          // Example of performing polynomial convolution
          double[] Polynomial = { 1, 2, 3 };
          double[] Multiplier = { 1, 1 };
          double[] result = Conv(Polynomial, Multiplier);
          // Print the result
          Console.WriteLine($"Resulting Polynomial: {string.Join(", ", result)}");

      Output: 


       .. code-block:: Terminal 

          Resulting Polynomial: 1, 3, 5, 3
