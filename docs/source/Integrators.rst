   GaussLeg3::
      Description: 
          Computes the definite triple integral of a function over a region where the y-bounds are defined by a function of x for the lower bound and a constant for the upper bound, and the z-bounds are defined by functions of x and y, using adaptive Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
      Param: 
         | fun:  The function to integrate. The function should accept three doubles (x, y, z) and return a double.
         | x_1:  The lower bound of the x integration.
         | x_2:  The upper bound of the x integration.
         | y_1:  A function that defines the lower bound of the y integration as a function of x. It should accept a double (x) and return a double (y).
         | y_2:  The upper bound of the y integration. This is a constant value.
         | z_1:  A function that defines the lower bound of the z integration as a function of x and y. It should accept two doubles (x, y) and return a double (z).
         | z_2:  A function that defines the upper bound of the z integration as a function of x and y. It should accept two doubles (x, y) and return a double (z).
         | eps:  The desired relative accuracy. The default value is 1e-6.
      Returns: 
          The approximate value of the definite triple integral.
      Remark: 
         |  This method uses adaptive Gauss-Legendre quadrature to approximate the triple integral.
         |  The integration is performed over the region defined by x_1 <= x <= x_2, y_1(x) <= y <= y_2, and z_1(x, y) <= z <= z_2(x, y).
         |  The number of quadrature points is increased until the desired relative accuracy is achieved or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
         |  For best results, the function should be smooth within the integration region, and y_1(x), z_1(x, y), and z_2(x, y) should be smooth functions.
         |  Ensure that y_1(x) <= y_2 and z_1(x,y) <= z_2(x, y) throughout the integration region.
         |  If x_1 equals x_2 then the method will return 0.
      Example: 
           Integrate the function f(x, y, z) = x * y * z over the region where x ranges from 0 to 1, y ranges from x^2 to 2, and z ranges from x*y to x+y, which can be expressed as:
