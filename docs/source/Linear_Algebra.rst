Linear Algebra
==============

Linear algebra is a cornerstone of modern mathematics, providing a framework for understanding and solving a wide range of problems in various fields, from physics and engineering to computer science and economics.

Applications:
- Physics: Describing forces, analyzing electrical circuits, and modeling quantum mechanics.   
- Computer Graphics: Representing images, performing transformations (rotations, scaling), and rendering 3D graphics.   
- Machine Learning: Representing data, training models, and making predictions.   
- Economics: Modeling economic systems, analyzing market trends, and forecasting.   


All linear algebra functionalities can be accessed through vector and matrices in the mathematics library. 
In essence, matrices provide a versatile and elegant framework for representing and manipulating data, making them an indispensable tool in various fields of science, engineering, and technology.
