One Transistor Amplifier
------------------------
This example shows how to solve a stiff differential algebraic equation (DAE) that describes an electrical circuit. The one-transistor amplifier problem can be rewritten in semi-explicit form, but this example solves it in its original form :math:`Mu=\varphi(u)` The problem includes a constant, singular mass matrix M.

The transistor amplifier circuit contains six resistors, three capacitors, and a transistor.
